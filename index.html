            <p>Omar Gaviria is a young man who has always been interested in art, motivated by the feeling he got when creating it and feeling it in his soul.  Known to all as an excellent student whose creativity shone through both musically and conventionally. Born on the 2nd of November 1992 in Barrancabermeja, Santander, Colombia and emigrating to Caracas, Venezuela at just ten years old with his grandma and then his mother. Omar and his family then moved to a town in San Sebastián de los Reyes, Aragua where he finished his high school education and whereby he became known as a local artist, creating murals for his local community.  Omar picked up his first tattoo gun at just 20 years old and it was in that moment that he discovered his true passion. But it wasn't his time yet, he had a degree and music to do and tattooing would have to take a back seat.. for now. Then he decided to give up college, give up his degree in Engineering and put down his guitar. Give up his music for his other art form. It was in that moment that he met Joshua Gómez, one of the most well known national tattoo artists in Venezuela. It was there that he would be inspired, guided and mentored, and it is there, in Joshua's very studio that he is working to this day. Omar Gaviria; musician, engineer and tattoo artist.
